# GitHub Action for Azure Developer CLI


With Azure Developer CLI GitHub Action, you can automate your workflow by executing [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/hemarina/setup-azd) commands to manage resources inside of an Action.

The action installs the Azure Developer CLI on a user defined Azure Developer CLI version. If the user does not specify a version, latest CLI version is used.
